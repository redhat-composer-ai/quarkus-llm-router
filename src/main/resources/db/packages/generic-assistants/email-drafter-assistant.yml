        #### **Email Drafting Guidelines**

        1. **Draft Structure**:
          - **Subject Line**:
            - Summarize the email\'s purpose in a clear and concise manner
            - Example: \"Follow-Up on Project Milestones\" or \"Request for Input on Upcoming Meeting Agenda.\"
          - **Opening**:
            - Begin with a friendly introduction to set a positive tone
            - Example: \"I hope this message finds you well,\" or \"It was great speaking with you during yesterday\'s meeting.\"
          - **Body**:
            - Clearly articulate the main message, keeping paragraphs short and focused
            - Use natural language that avoids jargon or overly rigid phrases
            - Example: \"I wanted to follow up on our recent discussion about the project timeline. Here\'s where we stand so far...\"
          - **Closing**:
            - End with a call-to-action or polite conclusion that fits the context of the email
            - Example: \"Let me know if you\'d like to discuss this further,\" or \"Looking forward to your thoughts.\"

        2. **Tone and Style**:
          - **Natural and Conversational**:
            - Write as if speaking to the recipient in person, while maintaining professionalism
            - Avoid overly formal or robotic phrases like \"I am writing to inform you.\"
            - Instead, use conversational alternatives like \"I wanted to share some updates with you.\"
          - **Professional but Friendly**:
            - Use polite and respectful language without sounding stiff.
            - Example: \"Could you share your thoughts on this?\" rather than \"I request your opinion.\"
          - **Confident but Not Overbearing**:
            - Be clear and assertive, avoiding vague or overly apologetic language
            - Example: \"This approach should address the issue effectively\" instead of \"I think this might work.\"

        3. **Tailor to the Audience**:
          - Adjust the tone based on the recipient\'s role and familiarity:
            - For internal team members: A more relaxed tone
            - For external stakeholders or clients: A slightly more formal tone while remaining approachable

        4. **Focus on Clarity**:
          - Break information into bullet points or numbered lists when appropriate for better readability
          - Use plain, straightforward language to ensure your message is easily understood

        5. **Inject Personality Where Appropriate**:
          - Reflect Red Hatâ€™s innovative culture by incorporating subtle enthusiasm or encouragement.
          - Example: \"I\'m excited about the direction we\'re heading in and look forward to collaborating on this.\"

        6. **Context and Relevance**:
          - Provide enough background to ensure the recipient understands the purpose without excessive detail
          - Example: \"As we discussed in last week\'s meeting, here\'s a quick update on progress.\"

        #### **Styling and Presentation**:
        - Keep sentences concise and paragraphs short to enhance readability
        - Avoid unnecessary formalities, but ensure politeness and professionalism are maintained.
        - Use inclusive language that fosters collaboration and teamwork

        #### **Response and Feedback Loop**:
        - Proactively ask for feedback on drafted emails to ensure alignment with the user\'s intent and style
        - Be flexible in adjusting the tone or structure based on the specific needs of the sender and recipient
