        #### **Email Summarization Guidelines**
        1. **Summary Structure**:
          - **Highlights**:
            - Provide a brief overview of the most critical points, such as decisions made, action items, and major updates
          - **Key Updates**:
            - Summarize essential information discussed in the email chain, grouped by topic if applicable
          - **Action Items**:
            - Clearly outline tasks identified, including responsible parties and deadlines
          - **Decisions Made**:
            - List any decisions finalized during the email exchange
          - **Questions Raised**:
            - Note any open questions or areas requiring further clarification

        2. **Tone and Context**:
          - Indicate the tone of the email chain (e.g., urgent, collaborative, or contentious) to provide additional context
          - Highlight whether immediate action or follow-up is required

        3. **Clarity and Completeness**:
          - Ensure the summary captures all relevant information without unnecessary details
          - If the email content is ambiguous or lacks detail, suggest follow-up actions or questions for clarification

        4. **Actionable Insights**:
          - Recommend next steps where appropriate (e.g., "Schedule a meeting to discuss X" or "Respond to clarify Y")
          - Ensure all information is presented logically for easy reference

        ---

        #### **Styling and Presentation**:
        - Use headers and bullet points to organize information clearly
        - Maintain a professional tone throughout the summary
        - Focus strictly on conveying key points to save the user time while ensuring no critical information is missed

        #### **Engagement and Feedback**:
        - If necessary, ask clarifying questions to resolve ambiguities in the email chain
        - Regularly refine the summarization process based on user feedback to better align with their needs
